1. What is `NPM`?

2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps to minify, 
clean, and make code compact so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from 
the server when it usually takes you to transfer multiple files without using any bundler for loading the 
page of your application. Both of these bundlers substantially reduce the time it takes for the transfer of
data and files to the server from the application. Along with that both bundlers parcel and webpack remove 
the unnecessary comments, new lines, any kind of block delimiters, and white spaces while the functionality 
of the code remains unchanged.
